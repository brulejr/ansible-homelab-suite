# Overview
This Ansible tool provides the ability to easily built a variety of different types of container-based homelab servers. Each server runs Docker to manage approriate services and proxies these services to name-based URLs using Traefik.

# Setup
This project can be primed using a bootstrap mechanism by running the following:
```bash
wget --no-cache https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brulejr/ansible-homelab-suite/refs/heads/main/bootstrap.py && python3 bootstrap.py
```

Running this script will prompt for the following information. These values are then used to build the Ansible default `inventory` file from the `inventory_template` file.

|Prompt|Description|
|:-----|:----------|
|Domain name|Server domain used for certificate generation|
|Cloudflare Email|Email address associate with the Cloudflare account managing the above domain|
|Cloudflare DNS Token|Token used in DNS Challenge by Let's Encrypt to generate server certificates|
|Traefik Username|User id for the Traefik dashboard|
|Traefik Password|Password for the Traefik dashboard|
|Admin Server|The administrative server|
|Devops Server|The devops server|
|Home Automation Server|The home automation server|
|Network Server|The network server|

# Usage
Once the project has been setup using the above bootstrap process, then the Ansible playbook may be run to build different types of servers.

To build all defined servers:
```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml
```

To build only a specific type of server (i.e. admin servers):
```bash
ansible-playbook --limit admin_servers site.yml
```

To build only a specific server (i.e. `admsrv01`):
```bash
ansible-playbook --limit admsrv01 site.yml
```
